<h1>API Hack</h1>

Integrates the Google Maps API and Flickr API to allow users to search for a location and show a map displaying markers with the geolocations of Flickr photos taken in that area. If the user clicks on a marker, more details about the image are shown, such as which user the image belongs to, a description, and tags. There is also a gallery view which shows all the pictures in the area in descending order by the date which each photo was taken.
